        <h3>About Linked Data</h3>
        <p>"<strong><em>Linked Data</em></strong>" refers to a set of standards, practices, and tools for publishing and linking structured data on the Web. Data that is Linked Data is linked to other data and can in turn be linked from other data. It is data that is published in a machine-readable way because all data is explicitly described in meaning and in format. For data publishers, it aims to efficiently maximise the capacity for interoperability and correct interpretation of published data. For data consumers it aims to maximise the efficient and correct re-use of data. </p>

    <p>The Australian Government Linked Data Working Group was established in August 2012 to meet the Linked Data challenges facing the Australian government.</p>
    <div class="grey" style="width:50%;">
        <h4>Governance</h4>
        <p>This Working Group is informal but some of its functions are recognised by multiple agencies. A Memorandum of Understanding, signed in 2017, is in effect between 6 agencies (<a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/">DTA</a>, <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/">BoM</a>, <a href="https://www.csiro.au/">CSIRO</a>, <a href="https://www.finance.gov.au/">Dept. Finance</a>, <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/">GA</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.naa.gov.au/">NAA</a>) which reserves the use of this web address, <code style="font-size:16px;">linked.data.gov.au</code>, for Linked Data resources.</p>
        <h4 style="text-align:center;"><a href="files/MoU - DTA and AGLDWG + ABS.pdf">Read the MoU</a></h4>
    </div>
    <p>As Linked Data technologies advance and become commonplace, it will be necessary for Government to become responsive to the demands of its citizens, as well as its own entities, with regards to Linked Data's use. Developing government arrangements and establishing technical mechanisms for Linked Data implementations will ensure Australian individuals, businesses and organisations can benefit from the opportunities these technologies offer.</p>
    <p>The Group is a community of Commonwealth Government Linked Data experts and champions with invited, non-voting, participation of individuals, corporations and other entities. In addition to drafting policy and technical guidance on the implementation of Linked Data for the Australian Government, members of the group also supply some core technical Linked Data services.</p>
